# The cinder_vol_host_index value specifies the index in the list of CND-VOL
# nodes of the host where the Cinder Volume service runs. To
# migrate Cinder Volume and Backup to another CND-VOL node, please specify
# the appropriate index value for that node. Leave a space between the colon
# and the index number.
# Note: If the storage input model is defined the cinder_vol_host_index value
# will be ignored and a default assignment of backends to nodes will be used.
# This default assignemnt can be overridden by specifying the assignment of
# backends to nodes in the cinder_backend_assignment.yml file.
