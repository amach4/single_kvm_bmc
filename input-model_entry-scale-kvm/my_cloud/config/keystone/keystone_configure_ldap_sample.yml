      #  2. LDAP is only supported for identity operations (reading users and groups from LDAP). Assignment
      #     operations with LDAP (i.e. managing roles, projects) are not supported.
      #  3. LDAP is configured as non-default domain. Configuring LDAP as a default domain is not supported.

        # 1. Please be advised that every time a new ldap domain is configured, the single CA file gets overwritten
        # and hence ensure that you place certs for all the LDAP backend domains in the cacert parameter.
        # 2. There is a known issue on one cert per CA file per domain when the system processes
        # concurrent requests to multiple LDAP domains. Using the single CA file with all certs combined
