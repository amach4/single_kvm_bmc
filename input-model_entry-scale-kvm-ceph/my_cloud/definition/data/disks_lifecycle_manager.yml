  - name: LIFECYCLE-MANAGER-DISKS
    # Disk model to be used for Lifecycle Managers nodes
    # /dev/sda_root is used as a volume group for /, /var/log and /var/crash
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5da e.g. sda1 or sda5. VSA appliance deployed on a host is expected to consume
    # ~40 GB of disk space from host root disk for ephemeral storage to run VSA VM
